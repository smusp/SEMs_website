Thompson, M., Lie, Y. & Green, S. (2023). Flexible structural equation modeling approaches for analyzing means. In R. Hoyle (Ed.), *Handbook of structural equation modeling* (2nd ed., pp. 385-408). New York, NY: Guilford Press.

Thompson, Liu & Green (TLG) show an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression approach and a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to:

 1. [One-way ANOVA](one_way_ANOVA.qmd)
 2. [One-way ANCOVA](one_way_ANCOVA.qmd)
 3. [Two-way ANOVA](two_way_ANOVA.qmd)
 4. [One-way MANOVA](one_way_MANOVA.qmd)
 5. [One-way ANOVA of a latent variable](one_way_LATENT.qmd)

These examples show the SEM approaches only.
