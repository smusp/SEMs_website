Thompson, M., Lie, Y. & Green, S. (2023). Flexible structural equation modeling approaches for analyzing means. In R. Hoyle (Ed.), *Handbook of structural equation modeling* (2nd ed., pp. 385-408). New York, NY: Guilford Press.

Thompson, Liu & Green (TLG) show an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression approach and a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to:

 1. One-way ANOVA
 2. One-way ANCOVA
 3. Two-way ANOVA
 4. One-way MANOVA
 5. One-way ANOVA of a latent variable

These examples show the SEM approaches only.
