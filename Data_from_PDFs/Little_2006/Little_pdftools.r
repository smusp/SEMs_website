## Getting summary data (correlations, means, and standard deviations)
## from Appendix A (pp. 71-72) of:

## Little, T., Slegers, D., & Card, N. (2006). A non-arbitrary method of 
## identifying and scaling latent variables in SEM and MACS models. 
## Structural Equation Modeling, 13(1), 59-72.

### Using pdftools package ###

## Required package
library(pdftools)


## Appendix A is in Little.pdf.

## pdf_text() (from pdftools package) creates a vector with one string per page.
## Select the pages containing Appendix A - pages 13 and 14 of the pdf.
## Appendix A is not a table, it is LISREL script. 
## Summary data (correlations, means, and standard deviations) are coded
## into the script. The data is spread across both pages.
## In LISREL, 'ME' contains means;
## 'SD' contains standard deviations;
## and 'KM' contains the lower triangle of correlations
## with ones along the diagonal. 
## The first page contains summary data for Grade 7,
## the second page contains summary data for Grade 8. 
## The variable names are given in 'LA'.
## 
## strsplit() splits the string at the line breaks to create a vector with 
## one string per line.
## Select the lines that contain the correlations, means, and standard deviations. 
## I've also selected the line (42) that contains the variable names, 
## but moved it to the first position.
pdf <- "Little.pdf" 
(tab <- pdf_text(pdf)[13:14])
(tab <- unlist(strsplit(tab[c(1,2)], "\\n+")))
(tab <- tab[c(42, 31, 33, 35:40, 59, 61, 63:68)])


## For each line, trim off the leading white space, and
## reduce internal white space to a single space.
## strsplit() - each line becomes an element in a list, 
## and each string is split at the space into separate strings.
tab <- trimws(gsub("\\s+", " ", tab))
(tab <- strsplit(tab, split = " "))


## Variable names are in 1st element of the list.
## I make the names a little more compact by removing "AFF" from each.
names <- tab[[1]]
(names <- gsub("AFF", "", names))


## Means are in elements 2 and 10.
## unlist() the two elements;
## convert the strings to numeric;
## split the vector into a two-element list:
## the 1st element contains means for Grade 7,
## the 2nd contains means for Grade 8.
means <- tab[c(2, 10)]
means <- unlist(means)
means <- as.numeric(as.character(means))
(means <- split(means, cut(seq_along(means), 2, labels = c("Grade 7", "Grade 8"))))


## Standard Deviations are in elements 3 and 11.
## Apply the same process as was applied to the means.
sd <- tab[c(3, 11)]
sd <- unlist(sd)
sd <- as.numeric(as.character(sd))
(sd <- split(sd, cut(seq_along(sd), 2, labels = c("Grade 7", "Grade 8"))))


## Correlations in elements 4 to 9, and elements 12 to 17
## Note: what appear to be minus signs are not minus signs 
## (possibly they are em dashes). 
## Replace with a minus signs.
## Then apply the same process as above.
cor <- tab[c(4:9, 12:17)]
cor <- lapply(cor, function(x) gsub("—", "-", x))
cor <- unlist(cor)
cor <- as.numeric(as.character(cor))
(cor <- split(cor, cut(seq_along(cor), 2, labels = c("Grade 7", "Grade 8"))))
